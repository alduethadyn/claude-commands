**Assignee:** user@example.com (default to ENV['JIRA_EMAIL'])

## Description

### Background
*(Provide a concise explanation of the problem or the context. Why is this work needed? What user problem does it solve, or what technical debt does it address? Keep it brief and focused.)*

### Proposed Solution
*(Give a high-level overview of the technical approach or the intended change. Avoid excessive jargon, but provide enough detail for an engineer to understand the direction. Focus on the "what" and "why" more than the deep "how".)*

## References and Notes

*   *Code Context:*
    *   *(Link to relevant file(s) and line number(s) using standard Markdown GitHub permalinks: `[path/to/file.rb#L1-L10](github-permalink-url)`)*

    *   *(Link to related JIRA tickets, design documents, or other relevant resources.)*
*   *Testing Considerations:*
    *   *(Mention any specific testing requirements, edge cases to consider, or areas that might need regression testing. Note if specific types of tests (unit, integration, E2E) are expected.)*
    *   *(Are there specific test helpers or fixtures that should be used?)*
*   *Rollout/Deployment:*
    *   *(Are there feature flags involved (the default answer is yes)? Any specific deployment steps or considerations? Any potential risks or monitoring needs post-deployment?)*
*   *Other Notes:*
    *   *(Any other relevant details, potential challenges, or points of clarification.)*

## Acceptance Criteria

*   *(List clear, specific, and testable conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. These should reflect the desired outcome from a user or system perspective. No need to add an A/C about adding test coverage unless specifically asked. It is assumed test coverage is required for every change. It is assumed most if not all changes will be rolled out with an "Arturo" (no quotes needed when referencing in output) feature flag)*
*   *(Example: When a user performs action X, outcome Y occurs.)*
*   *(Example: The system correctly handles scenario Z without errors.)*
*   *(Example: Relevant unit/integration tests are added/updated and pass.)*
*   *(Example: Feature flag [flag_name] controls the new behavior.)*
*   *(Example: Documentation is updated to reflect the changes.)*
