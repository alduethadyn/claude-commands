## User Authentication Enhancement

### Project Information
**Project:** EM
**Priority:** Low
**Labels:** security, authentication
**Assignee:** developer@zendesk.com

## Description

*(Users are experiencing difficulties with the current login flow, particularly when using two-factor authentication. This enhancement will streamline the authentication process and improve security.)*

*(Implement OAuth 2.0 integration with improved session management and enhanced two-factor authentication support. The solution will include fallback mechanisms and better error handling for authentication failures.)*

## References and Notes

### Code Context
* [app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb#L15-L45](https://github.com/zendesk/project/blob/main/app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb#L15-L45) - Current authentication logic
* [app/models/user.rb#L120-L140](https://github.com/zendesk/project/blob/main/app/models/user.rb#L120-L140) - User authentication methods

### Testing Considerations
* Unit tests needed for `AuthenticationService` class
* Integration test scenarios with **OAuth providers**
* Performance testing for `session_management` under load

## Acceptance Criteria

* Clear, testable condition: Users can authenticate with OAuth providers
* OAuth integration works with `GoogleAuthenticator` and `MicrosoftAuthenticator`
* Two-factor authentication flow completes within [30 seconds](https://docs.example.com/sla)
* Feature behavior when conditions are met: Successful login redirects to dashboard
* Error handling requirements with **proper validation** for invalid credentials
