## Refactor Email Parser Module

### Project Information
**Project:** EM
**Priority:** Low
**Labels:** arturo-removal
**Assignee:** developer@zendesk.com

## Description

*(The current email parser module has accumulated technical debt and needs refactoring to improve maintainability and performance. The module handles complex email parsing logic that is difficult to test and extend.)*

*(Extract email parsing logic into smaller, focused classes with clear responsibilities. Implement proper error handling, add comprehensive test coverage, and optimize performance for large email volumes.)*

## References and Notes

### Code Context
* [lib/email_parser.rb#L1-L200](https://github.com/zendesk/project/blob/main/lib/email_parser.rb#L1-L200) - Main parser class to be refactored
* [lib/email_parser/attachments.rb#L25-L60](https://github.com/zendesk/project/blob/main/lib/email_parser/attachments.rb#L25-L60) - Attachment handling logic

### Testing Considerations
* Unit tests needed for each extracted `ParserComponent` class
* Integration test scenarios with **various email formats** (HTML, plain text, multipart)
* Performance testing for `large_attachment_processing`

## Acceptance Criteria

* Email parser logic is split into focused classes with single responsibilities
* All existing functionality preserved with `backward_compatibility`
* Test coverage increased to **minimum 90%** for parser components
* Performance improvement of at least 25% for parsing large emails
* Error handling requirements with **proper logging** and graceful failure modes
